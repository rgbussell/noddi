## Code implementation

AMICO is written in two different languages:

- **MATLAB**: this is the original (and, to date, more stable) implementation of the AMICO framework. Code and documentation can be found [`here`](matlab/).
- **Python**: this is a *work-in-progress* porting to Python; please use at your own risk! Code and documentation can be found [`here`](python/).
